# index, it deletes and returns the last element.

popped = mlist.pop(2)

# If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you can use remove:
removed = mlist.remove('i')

# To remove more than one element, you can use del with a slice index:

# Lists and strings
# To convert from a string to a list of characters, you can use list

name = "John"
t = list(name)
print(t)

# The list function breaks a string into individual letters. If you want to break a string into
# words, you can use the split method:

names = "John McAthy Adams"
splitted = names.split()
print(splitted)


# Object and values
# In this example, Python only created one string object, and both a and b refer to it. But
#  when you create two lists, you get two objects:
a = "dog"
b = "dog"

print(a is b) # True

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]

print(x is y) # False

# In this case we would say that the two lists are equivalent, because they have the same elements,
# but not identical, because they are not the same object. If two objects are identical,
# they are also equivalent, but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily identical.


# Aliasing
# The association of a variable with an object is called a reference. In this example, there are
# two references to the same object.
# An object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object
# is aliased.
